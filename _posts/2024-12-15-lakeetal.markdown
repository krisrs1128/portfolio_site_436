In this project, we developed a tool to analyze and visualize the performance of
NFL defenses against running back plays.  The motivation behind this project
stems from the client’s need to evaluate defensive player efficiency and game
strategies.  By focusing on defensive metrics, such as tackle success rate and
Expected Points Added (EPA), the project aims to provide NFL teams with
actionable insights for improving defensive tactics.  

Our goal was to create an interactive and user-friendly platform to visualize
player movements, tackle performance, and defensive efficiency.  We leveraged
the “NFL Big Data Bowl 2024” dataset from Kaggle and designed features such as
play-level visualizations, team and player statistics, and in-depth analyses of
key defensive metrics.
