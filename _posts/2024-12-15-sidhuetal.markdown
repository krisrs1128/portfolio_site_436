The team created this interactive app to assist users in exploring and analyzing
educational institutions, providing a streamlined experience through a
user-friendly multi-tab layout. Each tab is developed to guide users through
different stages of the decision-making process:

<div style="padding-left: 10px;">
<b>Tab 1:</b> Broadly explore institutions or locate them based on commuting accommodations.<br/>
<b>Tab 2:</b> Screen and filter candidate institutions using key criteria.<br/>
<b>Tab 3:</b> Dive deeper into selected institutions for detailed analysis and insights.
